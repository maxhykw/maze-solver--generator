# maze-solver--generator

Here we solve mazes using depth-first search and generates random mazes of any size. It reads maze files (`.laby`), finds paths from start (S) to end (E), and displays solutions in terminal (with optional colorful output). The generator creates perfect mazes with guaranteed solvability. Pure OCaml, no dependencies - just functional programming at work.
